If you're like me, you can't help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful.\n\nHopefully this is the only bookmark you'll need in future ;).\n\nWhen I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I'd been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I've found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at over 300 books. \n\n\nMost of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable.\n\n\n## Searching\n\nIf there's something specific you're looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen.\n\n\n## Supporting\n\nIf you'd like to show your appreciation with a donation you're most welcome to do so here: \n\n<a href='https://ko-fi.com/I2I1K189U' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi3.png?v=3' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a>\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease feel free to contribute paid and free books - see [GitHub.](https://github.com/oscarbaruffa/BigBookofR)\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nIf you've contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!\n\n[Oscar Baruffa](https://twitter.com/OscarBaruffa), Mohit Sharma, [Vebash Naidoo](https://twitter.com/Sciencificity), [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge), [Erik Gahner Larsen](https://twitter.com/erikgahner), [Nicole Radziwill](https://radziwill.cc), [Nistara Randhawa](https://twitter.com/nistara_r), [Antoine Fabri](https://twitter.com/antoine_fabri), [Jon Calder](https://twitter.com/jonmcalder), [Mike Smith](https://twitter.com/grimbough), [Ben Bolker](https://github.com/bbolker), [Maëlle Salmon](https://twitter.com/ma_salmon), [Laura Ellis](https://twitter.com/LittleMissData), [Bryan Shalloway](https://twitter.com/brshallo), [Antonio Uzal](https://twitter.com/antonio_uzal), [Louis Aslett](http://www.louisaslett.com/), [Lluís Revilla Sancho](https://llrs.dev), [Brendan Cullen](https://twitter.com/_bcullen), [Rami Krispin](https://twitter.com/Rami_Krispin), [Michael Dorman](https://twitter.com/MichaelDorman84), [Ezekiel Adebayo Ogundepo](https://twitter.com/gbganalyst), \n[Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhammad](https://twitter.com/Shmuhammadd), [Eric Leung](https://twitter.com/erictleung), [Isabella Velásquez](https://twitter.com/ivelasq3), [Matt Roumaya](https://www.mattroumaya.com/), [Legana Fingerhut](https://twitter.com/LeganaFingerhut), [Robert D.

Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that's counted as 2 \"uniques\" whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users. \n\nFrom now on, you can view the **[LIVE site stats right here](https://plausible.io/bigbookofr.com?ref=BigBoofofR)**.\n\n## Discover more books\n\nFollow the [Big Book of R twitter bot](https://twitter.com/BigBookofR) which tweets randomly-selected books from the collection. \n\n## About me\n\nI'm Oscar.
