Start here\n\nIf you're new to R and want to learn how to use it, this library might be a little daunting.\n\n> There's so much choice! \n\nIf you aren't sure where  to start, then try one  of these options:\n\n### Book: R for Data Science\n\nThis book is an excellent introduction to R programming and gets you started with visualizing data so you see some exciting stuff, and the power of R, right away. \n\nThe book is free to read at https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\n\nThere's an accompanying exercise solution book at https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/\n\n\n\n### Video Course: Getting started with R\n\nIf you prefer video instruction with progress tracking, check out this course from \"R for the Rest of Us\" called Getting Started with R.\n\nhttps://rfortherestofus.com/courses/getting-started/\n\n\n### Watch a data analyst code live\n\nIf you’re looking for real-world examples of live data analyses, you’ve come to the right place.\n\nDavid Robinson, a highly experienced Data Scientist, has recorded many screencasts where he analyses data that he’s never seen before. These are fantastic examples of how to think about approaching an analysis. You couldn’t ask for a better mentor!\n\nAll analyses are done in R with over 80 hours of screencasts timestamped and annotated with detailed info. \n\nhttps://www.rscreencasts.com/ \n\n\n### Posit Primers\n\nIf you prefer  step by step instructions in an interactive online environment, then have a look at the Posit Primers which will take you through very very basic of data wrangling through to an introduction to building web apps with R!\n\nhttps://posit.cloud/learn/primers\n",
