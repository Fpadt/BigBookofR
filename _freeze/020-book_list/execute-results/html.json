One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations.\n\n\n\nLink: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/\n\n\n\n## Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R\n\nby David L. Carson\n\nThe first hands-on guide to using the R statistical computing system written specifically for archaeologists. It shows how to use the system to analyze many types of archaeological data. Part I includes tutorials on R, with applications to real archaeological data showing how to compute descriptive statistics, create tables, and produce a wide variety of charts and graphs. Part II addresses the major multivariate approaches used by archaeologists, including multiple regression (and the generalized linear model); multiple analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; distances and scaling; and cluster analysis. Part III covers specialized topics in archaeology, including intra-site spatial analysis, seriation, and assemblage diversity.\n\n\n\nPaid: Loan or buy $100\n\nLink: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/quantitative-methods-in-archaeology-using-r/DEAE593FA2418EA3B8ECD538C34ED2D5?fbclid=IwAR0guclfEtttfDkVKNUJWfhQ1wgUlXSKAIA3f_6D3hS_9EkUKivSY9AyFD8\n\n\n\n# Art \n\n\n\nThere are no books available covering art, but there are some blog posts available.

Upon first encountering the language after two decades of using Python, I thought Burns was an optimist—after all, hell has rules.\n\nI have since realized that R does too, and that they are no more confusing or contradictory than those of other programming languages. They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane.\n\nWelcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange. Welcome, thrice welcome, to R.\n\n\n\nLink: https://tidynomicon.github.io/tidynomicon/\n\n\n\n## Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) Companion\n\nby [Matthew Gregory](https://twitter.com/mammykins_), [Matthew Upson](https://twitter.com/m_a_upson)\n\nReproducible Analytical Pipelines require a range of tools and techniques to implement that can be a challenge to overcome, and this book address some of the common knowledge gaps and hard-to-Google problems that upcoming RAP-pers face.\n\n\n\nLink: https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/\n\n\n\n# Economics \n\n\n\n## Analyzing Financial and Economic Data with R\n\nby Marcelo S.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\n\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\n\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\n\n\n\nLink: https://ona-book.org/\n\n\n\n## Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics\n\nby [Keith McNulty](https://twitter.com/dr_keithmcnulty)\n\nIt is the author's firm belief that all people analytics professionals\nshould have a strong understanding of regression models and how to\nimplement and interpret them in practice, and the aim with this book is\nto provide those who need it with help in getting there.\n\nFor accompanying solutions to some of the questions: https://keithmcnulty.github.io/peopleanalytics-regression-book/solutions/\n\n\n\nLink: http://peopleanalytics-regression-book.org/index.html\n\n\n\n## How to be a modern scientist\n\nby [Jeffrey Leek](https://twitter.com/jtleek)\n\nA book about how to be a scientist the modern, open-source way.

Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare.\n\nThose working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this.\n\nThe statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this.\n\nThis book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.\n\n\n\nLink: https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/\n\n\n\n## R for applied epidemiology and public health\n\nby [EpiR authors](https://twitter.com/epiRhandbook)\n\nThis handbook is produced by a collaboration of epidemiologists from around the world drawing upon experience with organizations including local, state, provincial, and national health agencies, the World Health Organization (WHO), Médecins Sans Frontières / Doctors without Borders (MSF), hospital systems, and academic institutions.

Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc\n\nThis is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice.\nI expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them.

This book is definitely a niche topic and is more of a fun project than something you would want to do for work. The premise is that you can represent characters as a sequence of random numbers you uniquely generate, and with the help of a neural network, a message can be embedded in a matrix of numbers. In the book, I also describe how this method can be used to embed messages in images.\n\n\n\nPaid: Free and paid $15\n\nLink: https://www.statswithr.com/neural-cryptography-using-keras-in-r\n\n\n\n## Neural Networks with Keras in R: A QuickStart Guide\n\nby Michael Harris\n\nI wrote this book for people who primarily use other statistical software like SPSS or SAS, and want to get started in deep learning with Keras.

One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application to classify land use and land cover. Information on land is critical for sustainable development because our growing demand for natural resources is causing significant environmental impacts. The target audience for sits is the new generation of specialists who understand the principles of remote sensing and can write scripts in R. Ideally, users should have basic knowledge of data science methods using R.\n\nThis book presents sits, an open-source R package for land use and land cover classification using big Earth observation data.\n\n\n\nLink: https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/\n\n\n\n# Network analysis \n\n\n\n## Awesome network analysis\n\n\n\nNot a book, but a compendium of resources that look really valuable.\n\n\n\nLink: https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis\n\n\n\n## Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics With Examples in R and Python\n\nby [Keith McNulty](https://twitter.com/dr_keithmcnulty)\n\nThe technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time.\n\nBut here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be.\n\nThis book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.\n\n\n\nLink: https://ona-book.org/\n\n\n\n## Network Analysis in R Cookbook\n\nby Sacha Epskamp\n\n[Oscar Baruffa: Note this resource is a bit out of date, but because there are so few available on this topic, and it might still be good as a reference, it'll stay in Big Book of R for now.]\n\n\n\nLink: https://web.archive.org/web/20210414173702/http://sachaepskamp.com/files/Cookbook.html\n\n\n\n## Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R\n\nby Kolaczyk, Eric D., Csárdi, Gábor\n\nThis book is the first of its kind in network research.

We have tried to simplify the content of\nthis book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal\nexperience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is\nnot intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would\nbe an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory\nstatistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to\nhighlight some of R's capabilities.

Wendy Huynh\n\nHello! My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work.\n\nMany fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject.\n\nAlthough there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.\n\n\n\nLink: https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/\n\n\n\n## R in Action, Third Edition, Data analysis and graphics with R and Tidyverse\n\nby Robert I.

Tsuda\n\nRcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It\nis easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is\nimplemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And\nRcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can\nget high performance outcome.\n\nThis document focuses on providing necessary information to users who\nare not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of\nRcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint\nof C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it.\n\n\n\nLink: https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/\n\n\n\n## The R Inferno\n\nby Patrick Burns\n\nIf R's behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for\nmany more surprises, written in the style of Dante.

I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and programming is a means to that end. You will not become an expert programmer - that is a given. But you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your research.\n\nWe will cover many different topics in this course, including:\n\n- Elementary programming techniques (e.g. loops, conditional statements,\n  functions)\n- Writing reusable, interpretable code\n- Problem-solving - debugging programs for errors\n- Obtaining, importing, and munging data from a variety of sources\n- Performing statistical analysis\n- Visualizing information\n- Creating interactive reports\n- Generating reproducible research\n\n\n\nLink: https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/intro-to-course/\n\n\n\n## Crime by the Numbers A Criminologist’s Guide to R\n\nby [Jacob Kaplan](https://twitter.com/JacobKaplanCrim)\n\nThis book introduces the programming language R and is meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets.\n\n\n\nLink: https://crimebythenumbers.com/\n\n\n\n## HR Analytics in R\n\nby Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Hendrik Feddersen\n\nThe intention of this book is to encourage more ‘data driven’ decisions in HR. HR Analytics is not anymore a nice-to-have addon but rather the way HR practitioners should conduct HR decision making in the future. Where applicable, human judgement is ‘added’ onto a rigorous analysis of the data done in the first place.\n\nTo achieve this ideal world, I need to equip you with some fundamental knowledge of R and RStudio, which are open-source tools for data scientists.

This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations.\n\n\n\nPaid: Incl listing of library availability $40\n\nLink: https://www.worldcat.org/title/using-r-for-data-analysis-in-social-sciences-a-research-project-oriented-approach/oclc/1048009316\n\n\n\n## Using R for Social Work Research\n\nby Jerry Bean\n\nOur goal for this document is to illustrate the importance of good data analysis practices and how R and companion packages support these practices.

It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa?\n\n\n\nLink: https://lost-stats.github.io/\n\n\n\n## Mixed Models with R  Getting started with random effects\n\nby [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/)\n\nMixed models are an extremely useful modeling tool for situations in which there is some dependency among observations in the data, where the correlation typically arises from the observations being clustered in some way.\n\n\n\nLink: https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/\n\n\n\n## Model Estimation by Example Demonstrations with R\n\nby [Michael Clark](https://m-clark.github.io/)\n\nThis document provides ‘by-hand’ demonstrations of various models and algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of them by providing clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with other tools.\n\nThe code was collected over several years, so is not exactly consistent in style, but now has been cleaned up to make it more so. Within each demo, you will generally find some \n imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the old code that was the initial demonstration.\n\n\n\nLink: https://m-clark.github.io/models-by-example/\n\n\n\n## Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy\n\nby [Eric D. Feigelson](https://science.psu.edu/astro/people/e5f), [G.

Caldwell, Daniël Lakens, Chelsea M. Parlett-Pelleriti, Guy Prochilo, Frederik Aust\n\nThe goal of Superpower is to easily simulate factorial designs and empirically calculate power using a simulation approach. The R package is intended to be utilized for prospective (a priori) power analysis. Calculating post hoc power is not a useful thing to do for single studies.\n\nThis package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R (2020). However, we have created two Shiny apps (for the ANOVA_power & ANOVA_exact functions respectively) to help use Superpower if you are not familiar with R. Reading through the examples in this book, and reproducing them in the Shiny apps, is probably the easiest way to get started with power analyses in Superpower.\n\n\n\nLink: https://aaroncaldwell.us/SuperpowerBook/index.html\n\n\n\n## Probability and Bayesian Modeling\n\nby [Jim Albert](https://bayesball.github.io), [Jingchen (Monika) HU](https://github.com/monika76five)\n\nThis book introduces Bayesian statistics in the undergraduate statistics curriculum.

Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is a book about how to use regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. It focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use fresh out of the box.\n\nPDF is free for personal use\n\n\n\nLink: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/\n\n\n\n## Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R\n\nby Christopher K. Wikle, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Noel Cressie\n\nWe live in a complex world, and clever people are continually coming up with new ways to observe and record increasingly large parts of it so we can comprehend it better (warts and all!). We are squarely in the midst of a “big data” era, and it seems that every day new methodologies and algorithms emerge that are designed to deal with the ever-increasing size of these data streams. It so happens that the “big data” available to us are often spatio-temporal data. That is, they can be indexed by spatial locations and time stamps. This book provides an accessible introduction, with hands-on applications of the methods through the use of R Labs at the end of each chapter.\n\n\n\nLink: https://spacetimewithr.org/\n\n\n\n## Statistical Rethinking\n\n\n\nA Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan\n\nStatistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan\nbuilds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data.\nReflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the\nbook pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually\nautomated.

These groups exist so that people don't have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach.\n\nThere's a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book\npresents key ideas you can use right now, explains why we believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will help you go further\n\n\n\nLink: http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html\n\n\n\n## What they forgot to teach you about teaching R\n\nby [Desiree de Leon](https://desiree.rbind.io/)\n\nThis book is offered at rstudio::global(2021), as part of the Diversity Scholars program.\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn about using the RStudio IDE to its full potential for teaching R.

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of\nthe concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.\n\n\n\nLink: https://edwinth.github.io/ADSwR/\n\n\n\n## Data Management in Large-Scale Education Research\n\nby Crystal Lewis\n\nThis book begins, like many other books in this subject area, by describing the research life cycle and how data management fits within the larger picture.

But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. \nStretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the \"detached single-family home\" stage can't get to the advanced \"mid-rise\" level without going through the middle stage. The \"missing middle\" in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have.\n\nThings like:\n\nHow should I organize my file structure when creating a new project?\nShould I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How\ndo I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high\nquality?\n\nThis book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.\n\n\n\nLink: https://howiuser.com/\n\n\n\n## R Without Statistics\n\nby [David Keyes](https://twitter.com/rfortherest)\n\nR Without Statistics will show ways that R can be used beyond complex statistical analysis.

This code has to be reproducible, documented and production ready. Not my original idea, but introduced by the UK’s Analysis Function.\n\nThe basic idea of a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) is to have code that always produces the same result when run, whatever this result might be. This is obviously crucial in research and science, but this is also the case in businesses that deal with data science/data-driven decision making etc.\n\nA well documented RAP avoids a lot of headache and is usually re-usable for other projects as well.\n\n\n\nLink: https://rap4mads.eu/\n\n\n\n## The Data Validation Cookbook\n\nby [Mark P.J. van der Loo](https://twitter.com/markvdLoo)\n\nThe purposes of this book include demonstrating the main tools and workflows of the validate package, giving examples of common data validation tasks, and showing how to analyze data validation results.\n\n\n\nLink: https://data-cleaning.github.io/validate/\n\n\n\n## The targets R Package User Manual\n\nby Will Landau\n\nThe targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.\n\n\n\nLink: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/\n\n\n\n# Other compendiums \n\n\n\n## Awesome network analysis\n\n\n\nNot a book, but a compendium of resources that look really valuable.\n\n\n\nLink: https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis\n\n\n\n## Bookdown archive\n\n\n\nAn archive all books published via bookdown.org. It's a very very big\nrepo.\n\n\n\nLink: https://bookdown.org/home/archive/\n\n\n\n## CRAN doc collections\n\n\n\nNote these projects are frozen, but they do contain a lot of resources\nin multiple languages.\n\nMany of these are quite old publications, but it doesn't mean they're\noutdated or not useful. If you're really digging for a specific resource\nthat you can't find anywhere else, it may be here. Good luck!\n\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html\n\n\n\nLink: https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-books.html\n\n\n\n## Data Science with R: A Resource Compendium\n\nby [Martin Monkman](https://twitter.com/monkmanmh)\n\nThis book grew out of my evergrowing collection of reference materials that was saved as an expanding array of markdown files in a github repo. By assembling it as a book, I hope that it will be more accessible and useful to other R users.\n\n\n\nLink: https://bookdown.org/martin_monkman/DataScienceResources_book/\n\n\n\n## R on the Web\n\nby [Guillaume Coquere](https://twitter.com/g_coqueret)\n\nUseful links for people interested in R.\n\n\n\nLink: https://github.com/shokru/rstats/blob/master/material/R_links.md\n\n\n\n## R project book compendium\n\n\n\nA searchable archive of 180+ books.\n\n\n\nLink: https://www.r-project.org/doc/bib/R-jabref.html\n\n\n\n## The R Series by CRC Press\n\nby A book series\n\nThis book series reflects the recent rapid growth in the development and application of R, the programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.\n\n\n\nPaid: $40\n\nLink: https://www.routledge.com/go/the-r-series\n\n\n\n## Use R! Springer series\n\n\n\nThis is a collection of some 70+ books. This series of inexpensive and focused books on R will publish shorter books aimed at practitioners. Books can discuss the use of R in a particular subject area (e.g., epidemiology, econometrics, psychometrics) or as it relates to\nstatistical topics (e.g., missing data, longitudinal data).\n\n\n\nPaid: All are paid products\n\nLink: https://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles\n",
